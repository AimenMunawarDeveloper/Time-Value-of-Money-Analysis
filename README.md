# Time Value of Money Analysis

A project for the Engineering Economics course focusing on the analysis and calculation of time value of money concepts.

## Project Overview

This project explores the fundamental financial concept of Time Value of Money (TVM), which states that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. The project includes analysis, calculations, and visualizations related to TVM principles.
